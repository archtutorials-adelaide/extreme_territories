In this tutorial we are going to explore how to import vector and features data from a shapefile into a Grasshopper definition using [Urbano](https://www.food4rhino.com/app/urbano) plugin. We assume that you already have installed [Rhino 6](https://www.rhino3d.com/download) as well as made the Rhino and Grasshopper online tranning from the assigment 2.
Therefore, this tutorial is divided in three parts:

* Installing software dependencies 
* Preparing the shapefile in QGIS
* Import the shapefile into Grasshopper

### Installing software dependencies for this tutorial
