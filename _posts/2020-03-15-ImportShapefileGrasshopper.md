In this tutorial we are going to explore how to import vector and features data from a shapefile into a Grasshopper definition using [Urbano](https://www.food4rhino.com/app/urbano) plugin. We assume that you already have installed [Rhino 6](https://www.rhino3d.com/download) as well as made the Rhino and Grasshopper online tranning from the Assigment 3A from [Archistar Academy](https://academy.archistar.ai/) on Rhino and Grasshopper Essentials.
Therefore, this tutorial is divided in three parts:

* Installing software dependencies 
* Preparing the shapefile in QGIS
* Import the shapefile into Grasshopper

### Installing software dependencies for this tutorial

This tutorial uses three plugins:

* *[Urbano](https://www.food4rhino.com/app/urbano)* which is a Urban Design Grasshopper plugin that for mobility and utilisation analisys of amenities, streets, and public spaces. Also, we can use it to import shapefiles into our Grasshopper definition.

* *[Bifocals](https://www.food4rhino.com/app/bifocals)* it will be used to display at the same time names and icons of components on the Grasshopper canvas. It is a great resource for who are starting to use Grasshopper.

* *[Legend_Settings]* it is a grasshopper cluster built for this discipline to provide settings parameters for a legend based on a <em>Gradient</em> component.

#### Installing Urbano and Bifocals

To install Urbano go to <em>https://www.food4rhino.com/app/urbano</em>
